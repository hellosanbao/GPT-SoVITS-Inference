/root/miniconda3/envs/GPTSoVits/lib/python3.9/site-packages/torch/_utils.py:831: UserWarning: TypedStorage is deprecated. It will be removed in the future and UntypedStorage will be the only storage class. This should only matter to you if you are using storages directly.  To access UntypedStorage directly, use tensor.untyped_storage() instead of tensor.storage()

Some weights of the model checkpoint at GPT_SoVITS/pretrained_models/chinese-hubert-base were not used when initializing HubertModel: ['encoder.pos_conv_embed.conv.weight_g', 'encoder.pos_conv_embed.conv.weight_v']
- This IS expected if you are initializing HubertModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing HubertModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of HubertModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at GPT_SoVITS/pretrained_models/chinese-hubert-base and are newly initialized: ['encoder.pos_conv_embed.conv.parametrizations.weight.original0', 'encoder.pos_conv_embed.conv.parametrizations.weight.original1']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
